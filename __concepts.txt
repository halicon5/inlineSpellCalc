Embedded Spell calculator idea

Basic Structure:

Stored with each spell will be three data fields:
	- Default to ask for discipline, overpower,
	- spell specific variables
	- form order
		- Data-element : Label
		- Requests default data values that have been stored in lastAnswer objects.
	- Report structure
		-Things to consider reporting:
			- Total Strain:		Calculated Strain: Optional
			- Total TAV:
			- 
	- calculationObject
		- A string calculated as an EVAL.      new Function(str))() will call the data defined in the string http://moduscreate.com/javascript-performance-tips-tricks/




Phase two:
	- Storing prefences.
		- Create a lastAnswer setting for every spell. Default those values any time that page is loaded.

Each field will hold a JSON object holding the values.  The JSON objects will be loaded on any screen that uses that data.
